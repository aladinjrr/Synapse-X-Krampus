# Synapse X UI For Krampus | Fixed Version
Discord: Aladinundead

The source of this is taken from [Synapse X Source Code UI WPF](https://github.com/Acrillis/SynapseX/tree/master/Synapse%20UI%20WPF) and edited to work with [Krampus](https://krampus.gg/)

When building it yourself, make sure it has the bin and scripts folder included in the release. You can also find those files in an old Synapse X folder you might still have lying around on your desktop.

# How to use!
Extract the UI and scripts folder exactly into the same folder as Krampus (Screenshot)

Then open Synapse UI WPF.exe under UI

# Requirements
[.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer)
